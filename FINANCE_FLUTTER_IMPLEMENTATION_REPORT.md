# FINANCE FLUTTER IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## Verdict

Finance Flutter is a **production client** for the existing Finance Laravel APIs: independent app, server-authoritative money/status/permissions, Shared Payments checkout only through Finance, Phase 10 e-invoice contract preserved.

It is **not** a rewrite of Finance Web and **not** an ERP merge.

Honest gaps that remain are **product-boundary** items in `FINANCE_FLUTTER_WEB_DATA_PARITY_EXCEPTIONS.md` (payroll UI, treasury matching, GL editors, POS invoices, Phase 10 `/invoices`, period-comparison charts). The data-parity pass below closed the previous client gaps: reports are ledger tables/KPIs (not a JSON tree), Flutter web PDF/CSV uses a blob download, and list pickers paginate. Password + Google login, workspace picker, finance eligibility, and forgot/reset screens are documented in `FINANCE_FLUTTER_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## Files modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Finance/Concerns/AuthorizesFinanceApi.php` — elevated owner/admin/manager + dotted permission map
- `routes/api.php` — Finance v1 auth + workspace groups
- `routes/finance-api.php` — client routes **above** existing e-invoice routes

## APIs added

See `FINANCE_FLUTTER_API_INTEGRATION.md`. Prefix `/api/finance/v1`. Sales product invoices live at `/sales-invoices`. Client notes live at `/credit-notes`. Existing `/invoices` and `/notes` e-invoice contracts are unchanged.

## APIs consumed (Flutter)

Login/me/logout, workspace switch, bootstrap, dashboard, search, customers, quotes (+ issue/cancel/accept/reject/convert/send/pdf), sales-invoices (+ issue/cancel/send/remind/checkout GET+POST/payments/reverse/pdf), payments (+ reverse), receipts (+ send/pdf), statements (+ csv/pdf), credit-notes, contracts (+ activate/close/cancel/generate draft invoice), expenses (+ attachment), purchases, reports, CSV exports, settings.

## Database changes

None.

## Permissions added

None. UI map is derived from existing Spatie permissions plus owner/admin/manager elevation (same idea as Finance Web, **not** cashier agent elevation).

## Tests added

Laravel: `FinanceFlutterClientApiTest` (12 tests) covering login/permissions, agent 403, wrong workspace 404, dashboard/customer outstanding, quote lifecycle convert, invoice validation/issue/pay/reverse, checkout URL without marking paid / no Order, statement + P&L, Phase 10 list contract, unauthenticated 401, GET checkout availability without creating Payment, convert-before-accept 422.

Flutter: originally **42 passed** (models/permissions + password/Google/forgot/reset/workspace/session + dashboard/invoice/quote/customer/receipt/permission gate + multi-line quote compose). This pass adds `field_coverage_test.dart` and `data_parity_screens_test.dart`. Laravel auth: `FinanceFlutterAuthTest` (15 tests). Laravel data parity: `FinanceFlutterDataParityTest`. See the data-parity section below for the latest command results after this pass. Historical Google/auth command results remain in `FINANCE_FLUTTER_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## Test counts and exact results

### `flutter analyze` (cwd `apps/hasim_finance`)

(42 tests; includes Google, forgot/reset, workspace gate, session restore)

### Laravel Flutter client API

```
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/Feature/Finance/FinanceFlutterClientApiTest.php --no-coverage

### Laravel Finance feature suite

```

Result: **306 tests, 304 passed, 2 skipped, 1 risky**, 2782 assertions at the original Flutter client landing. After Finance Google/auth: `tests/Feature/Feature/Finance` + `OrderPaymentFlowTest` → **322 tests, 320 passed, 2 skipped, 1 risky**, 2854 assertions.

### Full PHPUnit

```
php vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage
```

Result at original Flutter client landing: **723 tests, 719 passed, 4 skipped, 1 warning, 1 risky**, 5391 assertions.

After Finance Google/auth: **738 tests, 734 passed, 4 skipped, 1 warning, 1 risky**, 5454 assertions.

### Known skipped / risky / warnings

Pre-existing, not introduced by this client:

- Skipped: DomPDF unavailable (`FinancialCoreTest`); Phase 7 EGS / security-chain skips when local crypto fixtures are absent.
- Risky: XML generation test that does not query live business tables (`Phase6UblXmlFoundationTest` family).
- Warning: `openssl_x509_read(): X.509 Certificate cannot be retrieved` in `app/EInvoicing/Security/X509CertificateParser.php:21`.

## Data parity pass (Web ↔ `/api/finance/v1` ↔ Flutter)

Independent audit of Laravel Finance Web fields against the Flutter client. Matrix: `FINANCE_FLUTTER_WEB_DATA_PARITY_AUDIT.md`. Intentional product-boundary exclusions: `FINANCE_FLUTTER_WEB_DATA_PARITY_EXCEPTIONS.md`.

P0/P1 gaps found and fixed in this pass:

- Statement lines dropped debit/credit/description/`invoice_id` in the Flutter table.
- Customer/supplier pickers loaded page 1 only (DATA_LOSS).
- Invoice/quote discount, taxable amount, credited/debited, line unit/discount/tax rate were not retained or shown.
- Reports rendered as a JSON tree; inventory-valuation API was missing from `/api/finance/v1`.
- Dashboard omitted VAT/cash/purchases/net profit/contracts/recent expenses cards that Web already computed.
- Search omitted expenses/suppliers/contracts/purchases.
- Flutter web had no real PDF/CSV download path.
- Nested payment treasury/notes, expense method/treasury/recurring flag, contract terms/items/schedules/generated invoices, customer Saudi address/WhatsApp, supplier CR/opening balance, settings address block.

Flutter still does not recompute tax, totals, balances, or report numbers. Checkout GET remains availability-only. Recurring expenses remain a stored flag.

### Tests added this pass

- Laravel: `tests/Feature/Feature/Finance/FinanceFlutterDataParityTest.php` (rich customer + multi-line invoice + partial payment + statement + contract + expense + dashboard cards + search + inventory-valuation + customers page 2).
- Flutter: `apps/hasim_finance/test/field_coverage_test.dart` (rich Arabic fixtures; fail if models drop fields).
- Flutter: `apps/hasim_finance/test/data_parity_screens_test.dart` (statement table, report view, dashboard extra cards, customer picker pagination/search, quote filters).

Exact command results for this pass are recorded after the suites are run (see the appended “Data parity test results” section). Historical 42-test / 738-PHPUnit figures above are the previous landing and must not be treated as this pass.

## Intentionally excluded

POS/cashier, Booking, Inbox/WhatsApp/Instagram/Messenger, AI, payroll UI, inventory, second gateway, local ZATCA private-key logic, dummy Orders, Stripe/Local from Flutter.

## Production readiness

**Ready to ship as the Finance Flutter client** against the current Finance Laravel APIs, with the PARTIAL/limitation list above. Do not treat Flutter as a second ledger.
