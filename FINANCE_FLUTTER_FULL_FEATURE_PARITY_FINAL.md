# Finance Flutter — full feature parity final matrix

Re-audit after gap closure: Web reconnaissance → additive Laravel `/api/finance/v1` → Flutter screens/forms/actions → tests → visual QA.

Laravel remains the financial authority. Flutter (`apps/hasim_finance`) is a full functional Finance client on `/api/finance/v1`. Sales invoices use `/sales-invoices`, never Phase 10 `/invoices`.

## Re-opened WEB-ONLY decisions

### Quote create-time attachments — not a Web feature
Web quote create uses `enctype="multipart/form-data"` because it shares the document-builder form shell. There is no `type="file"` input. `QuoteController` / `QuoteService` never read or store uploaded files. Issued quotes remain immutable. Flutter matches Web: no quote-file engine was invented.

### Bank statement matching — implemented
Web treasury is genuine Finance: create statement, add lines, suggest matches, accept suggestion, complete. `BankReconciliationService` records links; it does **not** post new ledger entries. Flutter now calls that service through `/api/finance/v1/treasury/statements*`. Ignore-line is in the service (required before complete when a line cannot match) and is exposed in Flutter; Web Blade omitted the button. Matched-line undo does not exist in the service or Web.

### General ledger / chart of accounts — Web is read-only
`AccountingController::dashboard` lists accounts, journal entries, trial balance, and monthly cash flow. There is no journal create/edit and no COA editor. Flutter `/accounting` now shows the same read surfaces. Inventing a posting API would not match Web and would risk a second accounting engine.

### Company logo — implemented
Web `SettingsController::updateCompany` stores `logo` on the public disk and can `remove_logo`, skipping delete when an issued/cancelled invoice snapshot still references the path. Flutter uses GET/POST/DELETE `/settings/logo`. Binary storage stays on Laravel.

## Tests

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `flutter analyze` (`apps/hasim_finance`) | No issues |
| `flutter test` | 68 passed |
| `FinanceFlutterFeatureParityTest` (hubs, catalog, attachments, logo, dashboard filters, bank matching, workspace isolation) | passed |
| Additional Finance Flutter / checkout / billing PHPUnit | passed |
| Pint | dirty files formatted |

## Product boundaries respected

- No POS/Cashier, Booking, Inbox, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, or generic AI shell.
- No dummy Orders.
- No second tax/accounting/auth engine.
- No local ZATCA key management.
- No client-side payment settlement or authoritative totals.
- Payroll remains HR, not Finance Flutter.
