# HASEM Implementation Status

Status values: **Existing** (unchanged this phase), **Strengthened**, **New**, **Partial**, **Not started**.

This file reflects the platform-core increment plus the finance frontend ERP phase (`cursor/finance-frontend-erp-b600`). It does not claim the entire 54-module mission is complete.

## Frontend ERP phase (invoices, contracts, decision analytics)

Filters: date, customer, product, project, lifecycle, payment method. |

## Phase A (previous increment) — financial core paths

- Integer money math in accounting/tax/treasury
- Posted journal immutability + reversal status
- Inventory ⇄ ledger (COGS, inventory asset, skip double-count on PO bill)
- Purchase order lifecycle
- Treasury transfer + bank statement matching
- Ledger reports + period comparison + alerts
- Grounded copilot + finance search
- Leads + projects
- Country tax profile objects (SA/JO/AE)
- Additive migration only

## Later phases (not claimed done)

- **B:** Warehouses, FIFO/serials, POS shifts, purchase requests/returns
- **C:** Full report exports, cash-flow statement quality, dashboard/ledger unification
- **D:** Full CRM pipelines, timesheets, commissions
- **E:** Already largely exists for SaaS billing; keep hardening idempotent invoice generation
- **F:** OCR, confirmation-gated AI writes, statistical forecasts, anomaly jobs
- **G:** Versioned finance API + webhook events for new entities
- **H:** Official e-invoicing (only with current official docs)
- **I:** Load tests, restore drills, finer RBAC

## Tests added this phase

- `tests/Unit/Money/MoneyTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Feature/Finance/PlatformCoreTest.php`

Run (local):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
php artisan test --filter='MoneyTest|PlatformCoreTest|FinancialCoreTest|ExpenseAccountingIntegrityTest'
```

`phpunit.xml` includes a testing `APP_KEY` so the suite can boot.

## Production blockers / honesty

1. Dashboard metric cards are still a simplified formula; use ledger P&L for accounting close.
2. Copilot is keyword intent, not an LLM with tool-calling. It will not answer arbitrary questions.
3. Unique transfer reference is the idempotency key; blank references are not idempotent.
4. Stock is integer; invoice qty is decimal — quantities round at the inventory boundary.
5. Do not treat compliance profiles as a filed tax return or e-invoicing certification.
