# Hasim Mobile API (v1)

REST API foundation for the **حاسم** mobile app.  
Base URL prefix: `/api/mobile/v1`  
Auth: Laravel Sanctum Bearer token  
Workspace: resolved from token `workspace_id` and/or header `X-Workspace-Id` (membership verified server-side — never trust client IDs alone).

Response envelope:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": {}, "meta": {}, "message": "..." }
```

Errors (Arabic user messages):

```json
{ "success": false, "message": "…", "errors": {} }
```

## Authentication

| Method | URL | Auth | Notes |
|--------|-----|------|-------|
| POST | `/auth/login` | public | `email` / `phone` / `email_or_phone` + `password`; optional `workspace_id`, `device_name`, `device_type` |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | public | `{email}` — Password broker reset link; Arabic JSON |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | public | `{email, token, password, password_confirmation}` |
| POST | `/auth/social` | public | `{provider: google\|facebook, access_token}`; optional `workspace_id`, `device_name`, `device_type` — same login envelope as password |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Bearer | Revokes current token + linked push tokens |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Bearer | User + workspaces + current workspace |
| PATCH | `/auth/profile` | Bearer | `name`, optional `email`, `phone`, `locale`, `timezone` |
| PUT | `/auth/password` | Bearer | `current_password`, `password`, `password_confirmation` |
| POST | `/auth/avatar` | Bearer | multipart `avatar` image → public disk `avatar_path` |

## Device sessions

| Method | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|

## Push devices

| Method | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| POST | `/devices` | Register FCM/APNs token (`provider`, `platform`, `token`) |
| DELETE | `/devices/{id}` | Revoke |

`FCM_ENABLED` must be true with credentials before real delivery. Job queues pushes; without credentials it logs and skips (no fake success).

## Workspaces

Channels are opaque strings from core (`whatsapp`, `web`, `manual`, …). App does not implement provider logic.

## Email

## Email campaigns (bulk)

One `EmailMessage` per recipient (privacy). Asserts feature `email` + meter `email_sends` for recipient count before queue.

| Method | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|

|--------|-----|------|
| POST | `/ai/suggest-reply` | `conversation_id`, optional `content` |
| POST | `/ai/summarize-conversation` | `conversation_id` |

Does not invent Meta/HyperPay behavior.

## Realtime

Broadcast driver configurable (`BROADCAST_CONNECTION`). Events:

- `message.created` → `private-workspace.{id}.conversations` and `…conversation.{id}`
- `conversation.updated` → same

Authorize in `routes/channels.php` (membership required).  
Production needs Redis + Reverb/Pusher/Ably — `log` driver is local-only.

Auth for private channels: Sanctum Bearer via `/api/broadcasting/auth` (Laravel broadcasting routes).

## Idempotency

Header `Idempotency-Key` on mutating mobile routes. Keys are scoped to `user + key + route`.

## Rate limits

Named limiters: `mobile-login`, `mobile-api`, `mobile-messages`, `mobile-email`, `mobile-ai`, `mobile-attachments`, `mobile-write`, `mobile-search`.

## Security notes

- Tenant isolation via `WorkspaceContext` + membership middleware + policies
- Private attachment disk; signed download URLs
- No mass-assignment of verification/plan fields from mobile
- Do not log tokens, passwords, or full sensitive message bodies in push/audit

## Flutter contract (minimal)

1. Login → store token + workspace  
2. Send `Authorization: Bearer` + `X-Workspace-Id`  
3. Subscribe private channels after broadcasting auth  
4. Register FCM/APNs via `/devices`  
5. Use cursor `meta.next_cursor` for lists  
6. Send `Idempotency-Key` UUID for message/email/booking mutations  

Existing `/api/*` routes remain unchanged.
